1.  [Readings](#org1213d1c)

This project exploits our work on demand for food and is focused on
evaluating what kinds of **policies** might be effective at improving
nutritional outcomes for particular populations.  Our earlier work
addressed the question of how demand for different kinds of food
depends on prices, budgets, and household characteristics, taking as
given prices, budgets, and so on.

One of the take-aways from our earlier project is that the food people
*choose* to eat may be quite different from the foods that people
*should* eat, from a nutritional perspective.   

But if dietary choices respond to prices and budgets, it may be
possible to manipulate nutritional outcomes by changing either prices
or budgets.  We can assess the costs of this kind of manipulation
(e.g., the deadweight cost of a tax or subsidy); where these costs are
large we can also think about the value of innovation in either the
desirability or nutritional content of food.

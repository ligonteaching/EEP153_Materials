You can find the first edition at the link above. The main argument is spelled out in Chapter 1, which I encourage you to read.  A key point of the essay begins with [two postulata](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/311#Malthus_0195_20):\n\n-   **First:** That food is necessary to the existence of man.\n-   **Secondly:** That the passion between the sexes is necessary and will remain nearly in its present state.\n\nThese lead to a conclusion:\n\nAssuming then, my postulata as granted, I say, that the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for man.  Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio. Subsistence increases only in an arithmetical ratio. A slight acquaintance with numbers will shew the immensity of the first power in comparison of the second.\n\n.\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"edd06a2d-5360-402e-af0c-fa7826792d37","metadata":{},"source":["### Malthus meets math\n\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"9024ebda-c295-4564-80a6-4ce614c434d0","metadata":{},"source":["Malthus&rsquo; argument boils down to a mathematical assertion: that\n    population grows at an exponential rate, while food production\n    increases only linearly.
